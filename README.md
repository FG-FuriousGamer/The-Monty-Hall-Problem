# The-Monty-Hall-Problem
I coded the monty hall problem to prove the answer.

The Switch file shows how many times WIN OR LOST because of SWITCHING
The NO swtich file shows how many times you WON OR LOST because of NOT SWITCHING

U can change the number of times the test is run by changing the number in while i<=" "
